# Lombok Rust
[Lombok](https://projectlombok.org) port for Rust.

## Why?
Just because I can! 

This crate is not actually the must-have one for development in Rust (unlike Java world), 
but if you find it useful - it would be great. 
Anyway - boilerplate sucks, so get some proc macros stuff for decrease it.

Any feedback is appreciated.
